# Traffic Obfuscation with Tor – Pluggable Transports

## What’s the Problem?

Using Tor gives you privacy — but not invisibility.

In many countries or public networks (schools, workplaces, cafés), network administrators or ISPs can **detect that you're using Tor**, even if they can’t see what you're doing.

That’s because Tor traffic has a unique structure. It doesn’t look like normal web browsing. It can raise suspicion or even get blocked.

## The Solution: Obfuscation

**Obfuscation** is the act of hiding or disguising Tor traffic to make it look like regular internet traffic.

Tor supports **Pluggable Transports (PTs)** — small protocols that act like “disguises” for your traffic. They help your data “blend in” and avoid detection.

## Why Use Obfuscation?

- Avoid detection by firewalls or DPI (Deep Packet Inspection)
- Access Tor in censored countries or restricted networks
- Stay under the radar even in high-surveillance environments

## Most Common Transports

### ✅ Obfs4

**What it does:**  
- Scrambles Tor traffic to look random
- Makes it hard for anyone to recognize it

**How to use it in Tor Browser:**
1. Open Tor Browser
2. Go to **Settings** → **Connection**
3. Enable “Use a bridge”
4. Choose “Select a built-in bridge” → `obfs4`

**Best for:**  
- Simple obfuscation
- Most censored environments

---

### ✅ Snowflake

**What it does:**  
- Uses volunteers around the world as temporary proxy relays
- Dynamically changes connection points

**How to use it:**
1. Settings → Connection → Use a bridge → Choose `snowflake`

**Best for:**  
- Environments where `obfs4` is blocked
- Bypassing advanced filtering

---

### ✅ Meek

**What it does:**  
- Routes your Tor connection through big tech domains like Google or Cloudflare
- Makes it look like HTTPS traffic to trusted sites

**Best for:**  
- Countries that block bridges and monitor DNS

**Note:** It can be slower due to heavy tunneling.

## Comparison Table

| Transport | Use Case | Speed | Stealth |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| obfs4     | General censorship | Medium | High |
| snowflake | Bridges are blocked | Variable | Very High |
| meek      | DNS & bridge blocking | Slow | Extreme |

## Summary

Obfuscation makes your Tor usage invisible — even if someone is monitoring your connection.

It’s like putting a cloak over your data.  
Even if you're doing everything right inside Tor, **you first need to avoid showing that you're using it at all**.

Use Pluggable Transports if:
- You’re in a censored country
- You want maximum anonymity
- You want to stay one step ahead of surveillance

**🧅 Cloak your Tor. Disappear from their radar.**
