# 👤 Project: Becoming Anonymous Online – A Practical Journey

## 🧭 Why This Project?

In today’s digital world, **privacy is not a luxury — it's a need**.

Everything we do online leaves traces: websites we visit, messages we send, even the photos we share. This project is for those who want to **understand and reduce their digital footprint**.

But let’s be realistic:  
> **There’s no such thing as 100% anonymity.**  
Governments, law enforcement, or powerful attackers can often de-anonymize advanced setups.

Yet for most people — from journalists and activists to students and privacy-conscious users — **these tools provide strong protection** against common threats like ISPs, data harvesters, and surveillance ads.
