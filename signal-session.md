## 🔍 Why Not WhatsApp?

Even with encryption, WhatsApp still:
- Belongs to **Meta (Facebook)** – a company known for collecting user data.
- Requires your **phone number** and access to your **contacts**.
- Collects **metadata** (who you talked to and when).
- Isn’t fully open-source.

If you care about who controls your information, it’s a red flag.

## 📱 Signal – Familiar, but Private

Signal gives you the full WhatsApp experience — but without the spying.

### ✅ Why Use Signal:
- End-to-end encryption (Signal Protocol, used even by WhatsApp)
- Open-source and nonprofit
- Zero ads, zero tracking
- Works on all platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Features: group chats, reactions, media sharing, voice/video calls

### ⚠️ Downside:
- Still needs a phone number to register (but doesn’t expose it)

> 👌 Best for people who want privacy without changing habits.

## 🕶️ Session – Anonymous by Default

Session is like Signal’s more secretive sibling. Built for **maximum anonymity**.

### ✅ Why Use Session:
- No phone number or email needed
- No central servers – it runs on the **Oxen** anonymous network
- Messages go through Tor-like routing
- Open-source and decentralized

### ⚠️ Downside:
- No voice/video calls (yet)
- Slightly slower delivery sometimes

> 🔐 Best for activists, journalists, or anyone needing real anonymity.
