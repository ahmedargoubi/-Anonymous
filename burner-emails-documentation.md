# Burner Emails – Temporary Email Addresses for Online Privacy

## 🕵️‍♂️ What Are Burner Emails?

Burner emails are **temporary email addresses** that self-destruct after a short time.  
They are used for one-time actions like signing up for a website or downloading a file,  
without exposing your **real email or identity**.

## 🎯 Why Use a Burner Email?

Every time you register somewhere with your real email:
- You risk **spam**
- You risk **data leaks**
- You risk being **tracked or profiled**

Burner emails protect you from all that.
