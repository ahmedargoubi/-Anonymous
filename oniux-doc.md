# üßÖ oniux ‚Äì Tor Isolation for Any Linux Application

## üìò What is oniux?

**oniux** is a powerful command-line utility that isolates any Linux application and forces it to use **Tor** for all its network traffic‚Äî**without relying on traditional SOCKS proxies**.

It uses **Linux namespaces** to ensure applications cannot accidentally leak traffic, providing high-level isolation for maximum anonymity.

---

## üß™ Why oniux Exists

Routing everything through a SOCKS proxy (like with `torsocks`) is risky:

- ‚ùå Misconfigured apps can leak IPs
- ‚ùå Statically compiled binaries (e.g. from Zig) may bypass `torsocks`
- ‚ùå Malicious apps can ignore `LD_PRELOAD` hooks

**oniux fixes this** by using actual network isolation through the Linux kernel.

---

## üîß How Does it Work?

- Creates **network namespace** for the app
- Connects it to a custom interface: `onion0`
- All traffic goes through **onionmasq + Arti (Tor stack written in Rust)**
- Strips away capabilities
- Prevents **any connection outside of Tor**

> Result: no accidental leaks, even with misbehaving apps.

## üß™ Example Usage

```bash
# Check your Tor IP
oniux curl https://icanhazip.com

# IPv6 support
oniux curl -6 https://ipv6.icanhazip.com

# Access a .onion site
oniux curl http://2gzyxa5ihm7nsggfxnu52rck2vv4rvmdlkiu3zzui5du4xyclen53wid.onion/

# Start a Tor-isolated shell
oniux bash

# Launch GUI apps under Tor
oniux hexchat
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood

- Spawns a process using `clone(2)` with isolated namespaces
- Sets up `onion0` via onionmasq
- Mounts a Tor-friendly `resolv.conf`
- Drops all process capabilities after setup
- Forwards file descriptors via Unix sockets
- Launches the app inside isolated space

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

- New and experimental
- Linux-only
- Still not a replacement for full systems like Tails or Whonix
- Requires knowledge of how your system works

## ‚úÖ Summary

**oniux** provides serious protection for advanced users who want to route any Linux application through Tor with confidence.

Use it when you can‚Äôt trust `torsocks`, and don‚Äôt want to run an entire Tails or Whonix system.  
It gives you the Tor power of Tails, with the flexibility of a custom Linux setup.
