## What is Kali Undercover Mode?

Kali Undercover Mode is a visual disguise feature in Kali Linux that makes your desktop look like Windows 10.  
It's designed to help users stay unnoticed while working in public spaces like cafes, schools, or offices.

Instead of using flashy hacker-style themes, this mode makes Kali appear like an ordinary Windows machine.

## Why Use It?

- 🛡️ To avoid attracting attention in public
- 💼 Useful when working around non-technical people
- 🎭 Helps keep your activities discreet without changing system functionality

Note: This is purely visual – it does **not** add or remove any system protections.

## How to Enable It?

Just open your terminal and run:

```bash
kali-undercover
```

This will switch your desktop environment to a Windows 10 lookalike.
