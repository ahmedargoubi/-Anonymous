- Tracks everything you like, post, and read
- Owned by corporations – decisions are profit-driven
- Shadowbans, content takedowns, and moderation with bias
- Algorithmic timeline – you don’t control what you see

### ✅ Why Use Nostr:
- Fully decentralized — no servers or accounts
- Works with “relays” that send/receive posts
- No email, no phone number needed
- No censorship or tracking
- Works over Tor
