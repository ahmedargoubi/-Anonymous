## 🛠️ How to Install Tails – Step by Step

### 1️⃣ Requirements

- USB stick (8GB minimum, 16GB recommended)
- Linux or Windows machine to create the USB
- Internet connection
- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or Tails Installer
- Download ISO or IMG from the official site

---

### 2️⃣ Download Tails

🔗 Official site:  
[https://tails.net](https://tails.net)

Download the `.img` file for USB creation (or `.iso` if you use the Tails Installer).

---

### 3️⃣ Create the Bootable USB

#### 💻 On Linux:
```bash
# Replace sdX with your actual USB device
sudo dd if=tails-amd64-*.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

#### 🪟 On Windows:
1. Open [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
2. Select the Tails `.img` file
3. Choose your USB device
4. Click Flash

---

### 4️⃣ Boot into Tails

1. Plug the USB into the target computer
2. Power on and access the boot menu (`F12`, `ESC`, or `DEL`)
3. Select the USB drive
4. Tails will load into a **live session**

---

### 5️⃣ Welcome Screen (First Boot)

Here you can:
- Choose keyboard/language settings
- Enable **Tor bridges** (if Tor is blocked in your country)
- Set an **administration password** (for sudo access)
- Launch Tails

---

## 🧊 Tails Desktop Environment

Once inside, you'll have access to:

- **Tor Browser** (all traffic via Tor)
- **OnionShare** (anonymous file sharing)
- **KeePassXC** (secure password storage)
- **Electrum** (Bitcoin wallet)
- **Metadata Cleaner** (removes metadata from files)
- **Unsafe Browser** (disabled by default – can expose your IP)

---

## 🔐 Persistent Storage (Optional)

Tails can create a **persistent volume** on the USB to store:

- GPG/SSH keys
- Wi-Fi networks
- Bookmarks
- Dotfiles
- Personal documents

This storage is encrypted and can only be accessed with your custom passphrase.

> You can set this up via **Applications → Tails → Configure persistent volume**.

---

## ✅ Tor Network Checks

To verify that Tor is working:

```bash
check.torproject.org
```

Also check DNS leaks using:
```bash
https://dnsleaktest.com
```

If you're using **bridges**, make sure your connection is successful.

---

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Maximum Anonymity

- ❌ Never use **Unsafe Browser**
- ❌ Don’t log into personal accounts (Google, Facebook)
- ✅ Use `.onion` services whenever possible
- ✅ Create new, anonymous email accounts (ProtonMail, Tutanota)
- 🧅 Use OnionShare or encrypted messaging (e.g., Session, Ricochet)
- 🔐 Set a strong passphrase for persistent storage
- ✅ Always verify your USB hasn't been tampered with (check GPG signatures if needed)

---

## 🛑 What Tails is NOT

- A permanent OS for daily desktop use
- Designed for gaming, development, or heavy computing
- A VPN replacement (Tor is not a VPN)
- Foolproof if you don’t follow **strict operational security (OpSec)**

## 🚨 Final Words

Tails is one of the most powerful operating systems for digital anonymity and freedom.  
But remember: **it’s only as safe as how you use it**.

If you're careless (e.g., logging into Facebook, revealing your voice, forgetting metadata), even Tails can't protect you.

> **Use Tails + Good OpSec = Maximum Digital Ghost Mode.**
